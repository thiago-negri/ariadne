ariadne
=======

Ariadne provides a "go-to-definition" functionality for Haskell.

Usage
-----

To use Ariadne, you need two things:

* install this package, `ariadne`, which includes the `ariadne-server`
  executable, and make sure this executable is running;
* find and install a plugin for your editor or IDE of choice.

Editor plugins
--------------

Currently, the following editor/IDE plugins exist:

* [vim](https://github.com/feuerbach/ariadne-vim)

Creating a plugin
-----------------

Writing a new Ariadne plugin should be straightforward (assuming you
know how to extend your editor/IDE).

If you write a new plugin, let me know so I can update the list above, and also
notify you when the protocol changes.

[bert]: http://bert-rpc.org/

### Conventions

In the protocol description below, we don't use Erlang's upper-case/lower-case
convention, because it would confuse anyone except Erlang or Prolog programmers.
Instead, variables and functions are written lowercase, and atoms are prefixed
with the colon, e.g. `:atom`.

### Protocol

You communicate with the Ariadne server via the [BERT-RPC protocol][bert] over
TCP. The server listens on the local TCP port 39014. The BERT-RPC module is
`ariadne`.

The request has form

    find(file, line, column)

where `file` is a binary string, `line` and `column` are integers. `file` must
contain the full path to the Haskell source file. It is assumed to be UTF-8
encoded, although this may improve in the future.

The `line` and `column` should probably be the current cursor position. Ariadne
will look up the name at that location. Lines and columns are numbered starting
from 1.

The possible responses are:

    { :no_name }

This means that there's no recognized name at the
given position. The plugin should probably do nothing in this case.

    { :loc_known, file, line, column }

This means that the name is defined at the given file, line, and column. The
`file` is again a binary UTF-8 encoded full path. The plugin should probably
jump at that location.

    { :loc_unknown, modname }

We don't know where the name is defined, but we know it comes from the given
module (binary UTF-8 encoded name). The plugin may want to show this
information to the user.

    { :error, message }

Some error has occurred. For example, the file has a syntax or scoping error.
The plugin is expected to present the error message to the user.

The message is a binary UTF-8 encoded text, possibly spanning multiple lines.

Other requests and responses will probably be added in the future versions.
